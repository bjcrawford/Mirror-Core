        						       camera to give you the impression of looking into a 
        						       mirror. Mirror mode allows you to view the image
        						       exactly as its received by the camera. Snapshots 
        						       and PhotoBooth pictures are saved using the Mirror
        						       Mode selected.\n

        						   <b>Themes</b>\n
        						   \n
        						       Themes allow you to select the general theme of the 
        						       mirror app. This changes the color of the action bar
        						       and all dialogs and menus. The app will automatically
        						       restart when a theme is changed.\n
