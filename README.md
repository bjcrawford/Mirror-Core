QustomDialog
=======

Qustom helps you make quick custom dialogs for Android. All this is, for the time being, is a way to make it easy to achieve the Holo look in a simple dialog that has a different divider color and text color:

Usage
-----
```java
QustomDialogBuilder qustomDialogBuilder = new QustomDialogBuilder(context).
		setTitle("Set IP Address").
		setTitleColor("#FF00FF").
		setDividerColor("#FF00FF").
		setMessage("You are now entering the 10th dimension.").

qustomDialogBuilder.show();
```

QustomDialog is really just a single class (`QustomDialogBuild.java`) in addition to one layout file ('qustom_dialog_layout.xml'). You can plug these into your project and use it in its simplest form as shown above. If you have the need for more complex layouts other than just a simple message, you can set custom views as shown below (it references an example layout `example_ip_address_layout.xml`).

```java
QustomDialogBuilder qustomDialogBuilder = new QustomDialogBuilder(context).
		setTitle("Set IP Address").
		setTitleColor("#FF00FF").
		setDividerColor("#FF00FF").
		setMessage("You are now entering the 10th dimension.").
		setCustomView(R.layout.example_ip_address_layout, context).
		setIcon(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.ic_launcher));

qustomDialogBuilder.show();
```
